# 3D Developer Portfolio

This is my personal 3D Developer Portfolio built using React, Three.js, and Blender. The portfolio is automatically updated and redeployed using Azure Pipelines.

## Technologies Used

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Three.js: A cross-browser JavaScript library used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser.
- Blender: A free and open-source 3D computer graphics software toolset used for creating animated films, visual effects, art, 3D printed models, motion graphics, interactive 3D applications, virtual reality, and computer games.
- Azure Pipelines: A cloud service that you can use to automatically build and test your code project and make it available to other users.
